# Hi there i'm John

Here are two of my projects (so far) that i have built and am really proud of
They are entry-level projects that have furthered my understanding in python and mysqld

## Python Programming project

This project was all about creating a front and backend server that would connect to a msqld database for all the stored data

* The project required students to create a a simple mysqld database and connect it to the backend of a server.
* The backend of the server then had to talk to the frontend of the server where customers would hire movies.

### MySQL Datbase

For this project one needed to create a databse for a school and and the alter grades or enrollments where required

* The project required tables for each entity.
* Then sample data was inserted into those tables.
* Lastly stored procedures, functions and triggers where implemented to access data and disply it in different views and new tables.
